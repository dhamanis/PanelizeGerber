PanelizeGerber
==============

For panelizing gerber files from CadsoftEagle6 (and possibly others)

This software depends on gerbmerge. gerbmerge is a painful to configure software that excels with panelize large arrays of different dimensions of boards. Due to the random algorithm, it struggles with making regular arrays on one design. That is what PanelizeGerber was written to do. A copy of gerbmerge1.8 is in a subdirectory of this source.

Requirements:
python
SimpleParse (module for python)

Tested on mac. Will run on linux. Edits will be necessary for windows use.

Use:
--Export appropriate gerbers from Eagle or elsewhere
	--Included is the necessary CAM file for eagle
	--Run prepareCAM.sh to create prepareCAM.cam. This file merely has paths set to put gerbers in the folder with panelize.py
	--for using other software, create these files:
		n.oln (outline)

		n.txt (drills)

		n.gbs (mask, bottom)

		n.gts (mask, top)

		b.gbo (silk, bottom)

		n.gto (silk, top)

		n.gbl (copper, bottom)

		b.gtl (copper, top)
		
		Currently panelize gerbers only supposed 2 layers, with this specific naming
--Run panelize.py. The command line prompt will lead you through the rest.
--Outputted gerbers are in the output folder.
